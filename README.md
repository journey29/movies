# Movies App :film_projector:

Users of the Film Catalogue project can examine movie details, look for movies using different search criteria, and add them to a list of their favorite movies.

**The project's primary features are as follows:**

1. Viewing a list of movies: Users can look at a list of movies that are available. Each movie's poster, title, synopsis, and other details are displayed.

2. Users can use the search feature to find movies based on a variety of factors, including the director, genre, and title of the movie. Listed films represent the search results.

3. Users can read comprehensive details about the chosen movie, including its rating, release year, cast, and other relevant data.

4. Add to favorites: Users can add movies to their list of favorites so they can watch them later or keep track of them.

5. Manage favorite movie list: Users have access to their list of favorites. They can mark movies as watched or remove them from the list.
